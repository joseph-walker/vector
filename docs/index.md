It allows you to automatically curry your userland functions with zero effort on your part. It provides useful helpers for composing simple functions
into more complex ones, all while maintaining a simple and declarative module loading system so your dependencies are always clear and concise.

## Major Features
- Functors and Monads
- Autocurrying
- Composition
- Haskell-style module system
